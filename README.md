Food Hub Project:
    FoodHub is an online food delivery app connecting customers with multiple restaurants, earning a fixed margin on each order.
    The data provided includes information on orders, customers, restaurants, cuisine types, order cost, ratings, food preparation time, and delivery time.
    Univariate analysis revealed insights such as repeat customers, popular cuisines, order cost distribution, and delivery times.
    Multivariate analysis showed relationships between variables like cuisine types and order cost, day of the week and delivery time, and rating and delivery time.
    Recommendations were made based on the analysis and center on approaches to improve the customer experience, drive revenue/growth and expand the usage of data driven decisions.
